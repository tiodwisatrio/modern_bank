============This project is called HooBank============

HooBank is a website that offers services to manage your finances, so you can focus more on taking care of your business. 
FYI, this project was built using React JS and TailwindCSS.

Follow this method to install react js and tailwindcss:
1) Go to your project folder directory, then type => npx create-react-app .
2) Then to install tailwind on our react application, type => npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
3) Then type => npx tailwindcss init -p
4) After doing that, the tailwind.config.js and postcss.config.js files will appear.
5) Open the tailwind.config.js file and paste the code as I have it.
6) Next, open the index.css file and paste the code exactly as I created it.
7) Finally, type the command 'npm run start' in terminal/bash.
8) React js and Tailwindcss applications run successfully.
